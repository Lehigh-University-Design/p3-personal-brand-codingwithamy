            <h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
            <p>Moo Deng is a pygmy hippopotamus living in Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Si Racha, Chonburi, Thailand. She became a popular Internet sensation at two months of age after images of her went viral online in September 2024.</p>

        <h2 class="life-info"> A Day in My Life </h2>
        <p> Moo Deng  spends most of her time sleeping. Hippos can sleep for up to 16 hours a day. Just like human babies, they need lots of rest to grow up big and strong. For the first month or so, Moo Deng was feeding off her mother’s milk. But as of now, she is 3 months old and has started her journey with solid foods, like grass. Soon, Moo Deng will transition to a fully vegetarian diet, consisting of grass, leaves, and fruits. </p>

        <div class = "life-info">
            <p>Moo Deng must be kept hydrated because her skin cracks easily when dry. Thus, she always gets hosed down by the zoo keeps every day. </p>
